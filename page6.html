    <h2 class="center">Copyrighting</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="center">A website is copyrighted at the time of development (graphics, content, visuals) so adding the copyright notice at the bottom of a site states the material displayed is not to be used without permission of the owner, sometimes the notice won’t be included as you do not necessarily need the notice to claim copyright, the law eliminated the requirement of public notice in 1989. Rights include reproduction, development of derivative works, distribution, public display. Breach the law of copyright can result in your website being removed and your company taken to court and being fined. - SitePoint.com</p>

    <h3 class="center">Accessibility for all users</h3>
    <br>
    <p class="center">Accessibility is often overlooked in digital projects, especially if the team doesn’t have a direct experience with any type of disability for example somebody visually impaired will struggle to read any of the information on the website so contrast would be an important factor in this instance. “The power of the web is in it’s universality. Access for everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.” - Tim Berners-Lee. Ensuring things such as font and size of the text are easy enough to read and understand for all people. Most websites don’t take this into consideration which is a big issue. - invisionapp.com </p>
