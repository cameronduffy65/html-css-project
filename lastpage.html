    <h2 class="center">2.9-Are the IT tools you used appropriate?</h2>
    </div>
    <p class="center">Yes I believe the IT tools I used were appropriate. Firstly studio code is relevant for the website as it ensures the website exists in the first place and all the content added in there is added through studio code. Using Trello allows me to track my progress so I know what tasks I have to complete and which tasks are already completed which gives you complete control and structure over your project which is always ideal and useful.

    <h3 class="center">3.0-Strengths and weeknesses of my website</h3>
    <br>
    <p class="center">Overall I am happy with my project, there are parts I feel I can improve on if I had more time, such as adding extra features like animations, more hyperlinks and extra images to catch more attention from the start off.
        on the other hand I aimed to ensure that my website was accessible for all users to read and use as when I was researching about accessibility for websites that was a major concern raised as people who are visually impaired cannot use the information the same if they cannot read it, I am also happy with the simplicity of my website as it is designed to provide information for all users.
