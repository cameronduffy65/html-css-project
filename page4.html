    <h2 class="center">1.5-Picking the right software</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="center">To choose the right software and use them correctly within a project is not a quick decision, there are a number of products that compete with each other, the amount of time to evaluate each one and also ensure you choose the correct one. But firstly you should know what you want the software to do initially, search for relevant applications, start excluding solutions (pick out irrelevant software programmes), trial the software you have selected to use, finalise the finer details of the system, address business issues, implementation times, support levels, availability and payment terms (not just the price) after following these steps you should have a good idea of what softwares meet your requirements and if any are right for your specific requirements.</p>

    <h3 class="center">1.6-How trello and github help</h3>
    <br>
    <p class="center">Trello has helped me achieve my outcomes as it gave me a certain structure and organisation that I could not possibly remember in my head, it also allowed me to monitor my own progress throughout the project to ensure that I am not going off topic or doing something that I should not be doing. Also it gave me the ability to show others how I have been doing which can also help tutors see if you are struggling in any area.</p>
