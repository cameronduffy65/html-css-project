    <h2 class="center">About Me</h2>
    <p class="center">My name is Cameron Duffy I am 19 years old, from Newall green in Wythenshawe, and a father to one. My interests are music, watching UFC and boxing. I watch a lot of football and support Manchester United which i'm not proud to say as we are not doing great at the moment.
    </p>
        <p class="center">The reason I am on the CodeNation course is because I used to build specialist computers and pc's, which has inspired me to choose this career path so i would like to pursue a career in web development and obtain skills in software development, also my options on this course are not limited as I can go into any IT career with the knowledge they pass on which not many companies do, my preferred career would be a web developer. </p>
