    <h2 class="center">Constraints in a project</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="center">There are 6 main constraints that can affect a project and potentially limit the process of accomplishing the projects goals. Time is a big factor in this as you need the project to have specific deadlines for delivering the final outcome, scope defines the actual desired outcome and ensures you know your end goal, quality of the project ensures you catch customers attention otherwise your project could end up failing, risks can be a major problem if you do not manage them correctly for example  your project could be completed and the risks you have not tackled earlier on will have to be attended to now and could change the format of your project as a whole and will result in it being scrapped. There are also 7 key website legal requirements which consist of disclosing certain information about the identity of your company (registration details, VAT number, trading bodies etc) GDPR regulations have to be met, company policies and procedures, consumer protection, accessibility (must be accessible to everyone who needs it. If not you may be breaching the equality act), cyber security and protecting personal data. </p>
