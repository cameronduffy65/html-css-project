    <h2 class="center"> Planning tasks using IT</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="center">Planning tasks using IT is a useful skill for any developer to have as it ensures you have a structure to your idea and as long as that task has been planned correctly it will guide you to your end goal. Not using plans for tasks will result in things being missed, forgotten ideas, or tasks being muddled up.
        Also companies are looking for people who can plan out their tasks for the day as it shows a sense of organisation as a person which will make others jobs around you easier.</p>

        <br>
        <p class="center">Some common digital project risks are poor communication, listening, no creative direction, no plan or structure, resources, workflows and demands, not recruiting correctly for the project, budgeting to ensure your project is able to be funded, data issues can result in loss of customer data, customer feedback may result in bad publicity or customer satisfaction issues, monitoring progress as if you don’t monitor then you won’t know what point others are at, have deadline dates to ensure everything runs effectively and on time</p>
